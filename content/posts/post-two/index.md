## Definitions and History
Several factors influence a patientâ€™s survival outcome, including intrinsic characteristics of the patient, the disease or medical condition, and the direct or indirect effects of any treatments received. Some of these intrinsic characteristics can be represented as prognostic biomarkers, which are used to identify the likelihood of clinical events, disease recurrence, or progression in patients with the disease or medical condition of interest. Others can be predictive biomarkers, i.e., biomarkers used to identify individuals who are more likely than similar individuals without the biomarker to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent.

## Technology Used for Biomarker Discovery
## Traditional Biomarkers
Traditional prognostic indicators in cancer include tumor size, staging, lymph node metastasis status, and the presence of cancer cells in multiple distant lymph nodes. These factors often correlate with a poor prognosis.
